# Dockerflow helps you developing Flow Framework and Neos CMS projects

[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/image/sebobo/shel.dockerflow.svg)](https://microbadger.com/images/sebobo/shel.dockerflow "Get your own image badge on microbadger.com")

DockerFlow creates the necessary Docker containers (webserver, database, php, mail, redis, elasticsearch, couchdb)
to run your Flow Framework or Neos CMS project. The package provides a wrapper script in `bin/dockerflow`
which simplifies the handling of docker and does all the configuration necessary.

We created this package to make development on Flow Framework and Neos CMS projects easier and
to create a simple reusable package which can easily be maintained and serves well for the standard project.

Development will continue further as the package is already reused in several projects.
Contributions and feedback are very welcome.

## Install docker

    https://docs.docker.com/installation/ (tested with docker v1.9 - v1.12)

## Install docker-compose

We use docker-compose to do all the automatic configuration:

    http://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ (tested with docker-compose v1.5 - v1.6)

The repository contains a Dockerfile which will automatically be built in the
[docker hub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/sebobo/shel.dockerflow/) after each change
and used by docker-compose to build the necessary containers.

## On a Mac or Windows

It has been tested working with docker for Mac but not yet with docker for Windows.
Feel free to try it out and let us know if you cannot wait.

## Install dockerflow into your distribution

Add `shel/dockerflow` as dev dependency in your composer, using the latest stable release is highly recommended.

*Example*:

```
composer require --dev shel/dockerflow 3.1.*
```

## Run dockerflow

    bin/dockerflow up -d

The command will echo the url with which you can access your project. Add the hostname then to your `/etc/hosts`
and set the ip to your docker host (default for linux is 0.0.0.0) or your boot2docker ip. You can also use any
subdomain with `*.hostname` and it will point to the same server. What you need to do is to add exact subdomain name
to your `/etc/hosts`.

The parameter `-d` will keep it running in the background until you run:

    bin/dockerflow stop

The default database configuration for your `Settings.yaml` is:

    TYPO3:
      Flow:
        persistence:
          backendOptions:
            dbname: dockerflow
            user: root
            password: root
            host: db
            driver: pdo_mysql

Also note that there is a second database `dockerflow_test` available for your testing context. The testing context url
would be `test.hostname` and this hostname should be added to your `/etc/hosts` too.

## Check the status

    bin/dockerflow ps

This will show the running containers. The `data` container can be inactive to do it's work.

# Tips & Tricks

## Using different FLOW_CONTEXT

    FLOW_CONTEXT=Production bin/dockerflow up -d

Dockerflow also setup a sub-context for testing depends on the current context you are running. In the above example,
it would be `Production/Testing`. Anyway, you can only use the parent context with the `bin/dockerflow` command. So when
there is a need to execute command for the testing context, you need to first get into `app` container and then call the
command prefixed by the context variable.

    FLOW_CONTEXT=Production bin/dockerflow up -d
    bin/dockerflow run app /bin/bash
    FLOW_CONTEXT=Production/Testing ./flow doctrine:migrate

## Running flow commands

    bin/dockerflow run app ./flow help

    FLOW_CONTEXT=Production bin/dockerflow run app ./flow flow:cache:flush --force

## Keep Flow caches in the container to improve performance

Add this configuration to your `Settings.yaml` in Flow:

    TYPO3:
      Flow:
        utility:
          environment:
            temporaryDirectoryBase: /tmp/dockerflow/Temporary/

## Using Redis backends for optimizing certain caches

For caches that has tags, Neos becomes slow with lots of content. Add the following to your `Caches.yaml` to
store those mentioned caches in Redis instead:

    TYPO3_TypoScript_Content:
      backend: TYPO3\Flow\Cache\Backend\RedisBackend
      backendOptions:
        hostname: 'redis'
        port: '6379'
        database: 0

    Flow_Mvc_Routing_Resolve:
      backend: TYPO3\Flow\Cache\Backend\RedisBackend
      backendOptions:
        hostname: 'redis'
        port: '6379'
        database: 0

    Flow_Mvc_Routing_Route:
      backend: TYPO3\Flow\Cache\Backend\RedisBackend
      backendOptions:
        hostname: 'redis'
        port: '6379'
        database: 0

## Using MailHog to test mailing

Add this configuration to your`Settings.yaml`:

    TYPO3:
      SwiftMailer:
        transport:
          type: 'Swift_SmtpTransport'
          options:
            host: 'mail'
            port: 1025

And open `MyNeosProject:8025` in your browser (use your own hostname) to see your mails.

Send emails from your Flow app and have fun.

## Configure ElasticSearch with `flowpack/elasticsearch` package

Add this configuration to your`Settings.yaml`:

    Flowpack:
      ElasticSearch:
        clients:
          default:
            -
              host: elasticsearch
              port: 9200

## Configure remote debugging from your host to container

DockerFlow installs by the default xdebug with the following config on the server:

    xdebug.remote_enable = On
    xdebug.remote_host = 'dockerhost'
    xdebug.remote_port = '9001'
    xdebug.max_nesting_level = 500

So you can do remote debugging from your host to the container through port 9001. From your IDE, you need to configure
the port accordingly. If you are using PHPStorm, this link may be useful for you to configure your IDE properly.

## Running a shell in one of the service containers

    bin/dockerflow run SERVICE /bin/bash

SERVICE can currently be `app`, `web`, `data`, `db`, `redis`, `elasticsearch` or `couchdb`.

## Access project url when inside `app` container

As of current docker doesn't support bi-directional link, you cannot access web container from app container.
But in some case you will need this connection. For example in behat tests without selenium, you need the url of
your site in `Testing` context while running the tests has to be done inside the `app` container.

Dockerflow adds additional script after starting all containers to fetch the IP address of web container and
append it to `/etc/hosts` inside app container as below:

```
WEB_CONTAINER_IP    project-url
WEB_CONTAINER_IP    test.project-url
```

You need to define the default test suite url in your `behat.yml` to use `http://test.project-url:8080` and then you can
run the behat tests without having to connect external selenium server

```
bin/dockerflow run app bin/behat -c Path/To/Your/Package/Tests/Behaviour/behat.yml
```

## Access database inside container from docker host

While you can easily login to shell of the `db` container with `bin/dockerflow run db /bin/bash`
and execute your mysql commands, there are some cases that you want to run mysql commands directly
from your host without having to login to the `db` container first. One of the best use cases,
for example, is to access the databases inside the container from MySQL Workbench tool.
To be able to do that, we have mapped database port inside the container (which is `3306`) to your
host machine through `3307` port.

## Running functional tests for Flow package

DockerFlow installs by default `sqlite` in the base image so that functional tests can be run out-of-the-box.
Example below is for running all functional tests of Flow Framework package in one-off command:

    bin/dockerflow run app /var/www/bin/phpunit -c /var/www/Build/BuildEssentials/PhpUnit/FunctionalTests.xml /var/www/Packages/Framework/TYPO3.Flow/Tests/Functional/

Make sure you run composer install with `--dev` mode when setting up your Flow project
and adjust the path to the test directory of your own package.

## Access CouchDB

From your host machine, you can access couchdb from web interface or command line:

__Web__: [http://0.0.0.0:5984/_utils/](http://0.0.0.0:5984/_utils/)

__Cli__: `curl -X GET http://0.0.0.0:5984/_all_dbs`

From inside your `app` container, you can also access couchdb through the command line:

```
bin/dockerflow run app /bin/bash
curl -X GET http://couchdb:5984/_all_dbs
```

## Attach to a running service

Run `bin/dockerflow ps` and copy the container's name that you want to attach to.

Run `docker exec -it <containername> /bin/bash` with the name you just copied.
With this you can work in a running container instead of creating a new one.

## Check open ports in a container

    bin/dockerflow run SERVICE netstat --listen
